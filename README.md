# Weather Forecast Backend

A FastAPI service that provides current conditions, today’s forecast, a 3-day forecast,  
and **two additional forecast days generated by a Random Forest machine-learning model**.  
It aggregates data from external APIs and returns a single JSON response to the Android frontend.

---

# ✨ Features
- Fetches current weather, air quality, and a 3-day forecast from **Open Meteo**.
- Extends the forecast by **2 extra days** using a **Random Forest Regression/Classifier** model.
- Converts city names to coordinates using the **OpenWeatherMap** Geocoding API.
- Caches data as CSV files to reduce redundant API calls and improve response times.
- Includes unit tests and a mock server to avoid exceeding API limits.
